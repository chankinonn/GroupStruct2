# GroupStruct2

**GroupStruct2** is a user-friendly Shiny application that provides statistical and visual support for species diagnosis. Although GroupStruct2 is optimized for species diagnosis, its analytical framework can be co-opted to infer group structure for any numeric or numeric + categorical dataset (biological or non-biological). GroupStruct2 combines robust statistical workflows with highly customizable, publication-ready visualizations based on the ggplot architecture, all within an intuitive graphical user interface that requires no coding experience beyond installing and launching the application.

# GroupStruct2

**GroupStruct2** is a user-friendly Shiny application for analyzing numerical, categorical, or mixed (numerical + categorical) datasets for species diagnosis. GroupStruct2 features integrated outlier detection, automatic testing of statistical assumptions (e.g., normality, homogeneity of variance), and adaptive selection of appropriate statistical tests (e.g., parametric vs. non-parametric) to reduce systematic bias. It also incorporates allometric body-size correction from the original GroupStruct package, widely used dimension reduction methods (PCA and DAPC), and supports joint analysis of mixed data through multiple factor analysis (MFA).
